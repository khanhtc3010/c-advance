1. Prove that at a party of 5 people, there are two people that have the same number of friends.
2. At a party, the number of guest who shake hand an odd number of times is even.

So your programing task is - modelling an example of these problem using graph
	A vertex corresponds a guest
	(know someone) a handshake - an edge.

Programs have menu interface that allows people to shake hand avec others.

Ex2:
In order to describe the metro lines of a city, we can store the data in a file as the following:
[STATIONS]
S1=Name of station 1
S2=Name of station 2

[LINES]
M1=S1 S2 S4 S3 S7
M2=S3 S5 S6 S8 S9
(DONE)

Make a program to read such a file and establish the network of metro stations in the memory using a 2 dimensional array
Write a function to find all the stations directly connected to a station given by its name

Ex3:
Implement the feature: friend recommend as follows. The system will scan

Prepare a text file describing the relationship in your group of friends in Facebook (A relationship can be: very good, good, normal, week (just add a weight for each edges)), such as:
	Binh: Nam 3, Mai 8, Hung 5
	Hung: Hien 6, Trang 4
	Nam: Trang 9
	Mai: Binh 1, Trang 7

Your program have to auto insert the symetric relationship. For example: Binh is a friend of Hung so that Hung has a friend named Binh
