Ex1: Let a file describe the perquisites between classes as the following
	CLASS CS140
	PREREQ CS102
	CLASS CS160
	PREREQ CS102
	CLASS CS302
	PREREQ CS140
	CLASS CS311
	PREREQ MATH300
	PREREQ CS302

Use the last graph API to write a program to give a topological order of these classes

Ex2:
Consider the following items of clothing to wear:

Shirt Slacks Shoes Socks Belt Undergarments
  1     2      3    4     5        6

There isn't exactly one order to put these items on, but we must adhere to certain restrictions
	Socks must be put on before shoes
	Undergarments must be put on before Slacks and Shirt
	Slacks must be put on before Belt
	Slacks must be put on before Shoes

Create a directed graph representing this relationship, then check if it has a cycle or not. If not, shows one way we can dress ourselves
